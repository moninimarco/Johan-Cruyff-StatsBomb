## Johan-Cruyff-StatsBomb
Uncovering the Legacy of Johan Cruyff in FIFA World Cup 1974. 

Thanks to **open data** provided by StatsBomb., I deeply examined the last five Netherlands matches from the 1974 World Cup, where this sample of data revealed a trend of Cruyff's visionary "Total Football" style. The focus is based on the concept of **JuegoPositional** and half spaces, by analysing his dribbles, duel won and where he received the ball more. 

The pitch has been divided by respecting the idea of Juego Positional. Plus, thanks to the use of the heat map it has been possible to understand which zones the Player covered more.

## Data
Open data provided by **StatsBomb**. Following the [Github repository](https://github.com/statsbomb) and their article who inspires me [StatsBomb's Icons](https://statsbomb.com/articles/soccer/statsbomb-icons-johan-cruyff/).

Through the **mpl soccer** package, it has been possible to split the football pitch by enhancing the half spaces zones.
